### Date created
I created this project for the Python class at Udacity.  I added it to my
repository on May 1, 2020

### Project Title
PCBikeshare

### Description
This project takes CSV data about bikeshares and does various data analysis
on it.  Functions include finding the most common dates and times, and also
displaying data about riders profiles (age, gender, etc.).

### Files used
bikeshare.py
chicago.CSV
new_york_city.CSV
washington.CSV

### Credits
This was my first Python coding.  I pretty much did it all myself, with the
help of some YouTube tutorials on Pandas libraries.
